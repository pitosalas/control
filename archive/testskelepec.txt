here is a brand new spec:
* print a prompt
* accept commands with one word: help and exit
* accept commands with two words "show design" "print answer"
* accept commands with parameters "print answer 14"
accept commands with parameters and options: "show design -brief" and "print-answer 1 12.00"
in all cases the commands just call a separate function that just prints the sentence "running commend xxxx"
Implement this spec in separate standalone programs for
