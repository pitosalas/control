# Current State - Control Package

* read claude.md and obey it fully
* read the rest of this document and make it part of your context
* adopt the todo list as your own

## Status: IN PROGRESS - Package Rename

Currently in the middle of renaming the package from `dome_control` to `control`.

### Completed Rename Steps:
1. ✅ Updated `package.xml` - name changed to "control"
2. ✅ Updated `setup.py` - package_name changed to "control"
3. ✅ Updated `setup.py` - entry_points changed to "control.main:main"
4. ✅ Updated `main.py` - class renamed from DomeControl to Control
5. ✅ Updated `main.py` - node name changed to 'control'
6. ✅ Main directory renamed from `dome_control` to `control`

### Still Needed for Complete Rename:
1. ❌ Rename subdirectory from `dome_control` to `control`
   - Current path: `/home/pitosalas/linorobot2_ws/src/control/dome_control/`
   - Should be: `/home/pitosalas/linorobot2_ws/src/control/control/`
2. ❌ Update all import statements in Python files to use `control` instead of `dome_control`
3. ❌ Rebuild package with new name
4. ❌ Test that CLI still works with new package name

## Todo List:
1. [in_progress] Rename package from dome_control to control
2. [pending] Add more movement commands (turn, stop, etc.)
3. [pending] Implement ROS2 topic subscription interface
4. [pending] Add command validation and help system
5. [pending] Implement TUI interface with textual (future)
6. [pending] Add error handling and logging improvements
7. [pending] Create unit tests for command processor
8. [pending] Add configuration file support

## Current Architecture:
- **Main Entry Point**: `control/main.py` with typer CLI
- **Command Processor**: `control/command_processor.py` - handles command parsing and abbreviations
- **CLI Interface**: `control/cli_interface.py` - provides "> " prompt interface
- **Robot API**: `control/teleopapi.py` - existing TeleopApi for robot movement

## Implemented Features:
- ✅ CLI interface with "> " prompt
- ✅ Typer-based argument parsing
- ✅ Command abbreviation support (first 4 letters)
- ✅ `move dist <float>` command integrated with TeleopApi
- ✅ Shared command backend architecture for future interfaces
- ✅ ROS2 package structure with colcon build support

## Current Issues/Blockers:
- Package rename is incomplete - subdirectory structure needs fixing
- Build system may need updating after rename completion
- Import paths in Python files may need updating

## Files Modified:
- `/home/pitosalas/linorobot2_ws/src/control/package.xml`
- `/home/pitosalas/linorobot2_ws/src/control/setup.py`
- `/home/pitosalas/linorobot2_ws/src/control/dome_control/main.py`

## Next Steps:
1. Complete the package rename by fixing directory structure and imports
2. Rebuild and test the package
3. Then proceed with additional features from todo list
